# These are my personal Nodes. 
On my journay through [**ComfyUI**](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) I discovered, some Nodes 
that would fit my needs. Maybe I am using ComfyUI wrong. 
But from a Videograph Point of View, there are so many 
possibilitys with this awesome UI. 

But sometimes I have the feeling, that it is tryed to add all the new fancy stuff without completing the normal logical missing Nodes that would be required for some very basic operations.

So I decided to add some Nodes for my own or try to extrakt the best usability parts from other Custom Nodes. 
E.g I like the Seed handling how it is done with [Efficiency Nodes](https://github.com/jags111/efficiency-nodes-comfyui)
Full credit for the Seed node goes to 
[LucianoCirino](https://github.com/LucianoCirino) who, I guess, started this Project. 

Also because I like [Image-Selector-Nodes](https://github.com/SLAPaper/ComfyUI-Image-Selector) and I discovered the possibilitys of using Loops in ComfyUI (proofed by [ltdrdata](https://github.com/ltdrdata) in his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLO0fg0SF9w)
